![about us](/assets/img/detective.png)

Bi-weekly content on humans and their surrounding.

<!--We have, on an average, 7 minutes of your time before you
leave this page and we can no longer jam an impression on you.
But we feel that your time is valuable, so here we go.
-->

We’ve grown accustomed to view everything from our tiny
modern life bubble. We’ve grown so dependent on technology,
entertainment, and social media in ways we don't understand.

<!--that we’ve forgotten to live.
When was the last time you were bored and you had nothing to
do? How many posts do you read on your social feed daily? and
how much of it actually makes you feel good?
-->

Earthly Humans is a self exploring journey and an initiative
to make lives more meaningful, by allowing people to connect,
understand, and enjoy the melodic convergence of earth and
humans. This is our visison, but we’ll execute it differently.

We believe that simple is better than complex, and that
less is actually more. So we won’t be wasting your time with
fluff, instead we’ll use a serene combination of thoughts and
art to convey our message.
